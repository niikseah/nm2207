                    <br>Since anime is growing in popularity, the market is becoming increasingly saturated. A website
                    like this will allow users to find anime to watch more easily.
                    <br> Key messages: I also want to showcase the popularity of an anime in relation to various
                    factors.
                    <br>Design elements: The website will be minimalistic and black and white. This will allow it to be
                    color-blind friendly, fuss-free, and easy to navigate.
